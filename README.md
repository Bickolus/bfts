# B.F.T.S - Blog For Tech Stuff

[![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, by using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

This application has been deployed to Heroku for testing purposes. You are more than welcome to visit it.

## Installation

Type "npm install" in the console to install the dependancies this application requires (Express, MySQL2, Dotenv, Sequelize, bcrpyt, session, handlebars). You would also need a MySQL server running to be able to create the database. 

## Usage

In order to run this program, a couple things need to be done. Firstly, the user must create a database by logging into their mySQL server ("mysql -u root -p" in a terminal), then typing "source ./db/schema.sql". Secondly, type "npm start" to run the server. Your localhost:3001/ URL will now have the site deployed.

Alternatively, check out the deployed Heroku link if you wish to utilize the site but do not want your own copy.
